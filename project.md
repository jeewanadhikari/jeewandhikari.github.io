## Past Projects: 

### Flood hazard modeling of kathmandu valley under climate change scenarios 
- **Study site:** Upper Bagmati Basin, Nepal
- **Goal:** Assess present and climate-change-driven future flood risk in Kathmandu Valley using Rain-on-Grid flood modeling.

**Method**: HEC-RAS Rain-on-Grid simulations to estimate inundation depth, peak discharge, and hazard maps.

**Calibration/Validation:** Observed discharge from Khokana station (DHM).

**Climate Forcing:** MIROC6 (CMIP6) rainfall projections for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 (2025–2099), processed with QM bias correction.

**Time Slices:** Near future (2022–2051) and far future (2076–2099); flood damage assessed for present vs. future conditions.

**Key Findings:** SSP2-4.5 shows steadily increasing rainfall and flood risk; SSP5-8.5 shows intense near-future flooding with a later decline. Maximum peak discharge was 2155.56 m³/s (SSP2-4.5, far future). Inundation area increased with rainfall, showing strong correlation.

### Research and Capacity Strengthening for Enhancing Water Security in Kathmandu Valley

**Study focus:** GIS map the pipe network and establish DMAs in Budhanilkantha Ward 10 to resolve pressure, leakage, and monitoring issues.
**Methodologies:** Applied geospatial analysis, population-based demand estimation, and Thiessen Polygon allocation to model and segment the distribution network.
**Technical Implementation and Results:** Created five sub-DMAs and optimized hydraulic performance in WaterGEMS using PRVs and pipe adjustments to balance pressure and velocity.
