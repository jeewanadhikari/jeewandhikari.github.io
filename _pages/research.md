## Research Experience 

### Flood hazard modeling of kathmandu valley under climate change scenarios 
- **Study site:** Upper Bagmati Basin, Nepal

*Study Area: Upper Bagamti Basin.*

Flood risk in Kathmandu Valley is increasing due to rapid urbanization, inadequate drainage, and climate-driven shifts in extreme rainfall. This study used the HEC-RAS Rain-on-Grid approach to model pluvial flooding and quantify inundation depth, peak discharge, and flood hazard under both present and future climates. The model was calibrated and validated using observed discharge at the Khokana hydrological station (DHM). Future rainfall (2025–2099) was taken from the MIROC6 GCM (CMIP6) for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, with quantile mapping (QM) bias correction applied prior to simulations. Flood damage and hazard were evaluated for the near future (2022–2051) and far future (2076–2099). Results indicate rising rainfall and flood risk under SSP2-4.5, while SSP5-8.5 shows stronger near-future flooding followed by a long-term decline. The highest simulated peak discharge reached 2155.56 m³/s (SSP2-4.5, far future), and inundation extent increased consistently with higher rainfall.

### Hydroclimatology and extremes
- **Study focus:** droughts/floods, rainfall-runoff, uncertainty

I’m interested in how climate-driven extremes shift hydrologic response, and how probabilistic and ML methods can improve prediction and risk assessment.
