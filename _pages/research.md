*A loop of model-data integration for hydrology, including model calibration and model-informed data collection.*

## Current research

### Flood hazard modeling under climate change
- **Study site:** Kathmandu Valley, Nepal

I build flood inundation models under extreme rainfall and future climate scenarios (e.g., CMIP6/SSP pathways) and produce hazard maps to support resilient infrastructure planning.

*Example flood hazard map (replace with your figure).*

### Hydroclimatology and extremes
- **Study focus:** droughts/floods, rainfall-runoff, uncertainty

I’m interested in how climate-driven extremes shift hydrologic response, and how probabilistic and ML methods can improve prediction and risk assessment.

## Previous research
### GIS-based susceptibility mapping
